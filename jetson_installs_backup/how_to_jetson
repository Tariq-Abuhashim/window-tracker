######### how to play with Jetson on host machine:


push Jetson to recovery mode (if need to flash)
- start with the Jetson Orin AGX devkit turned off and disconnected from the power supply.
- get the USB-A to USB-C cable and connect the USB-A end to your host computer and the USB-C end to the Orin type C port L.
- press and hold the FORCE RECOVERY button (middle button).
- while pressing the FORCE RECOVERY button, press and release the RESET button (first on right)


$lsusb
Bus 001 Device 011: ID 0955:7023 NVidia Corp


how to flash
start SDKManager while jetson in recovery mode
when reaching STEP 3,  new window with "SDK Manager is about to flash your Jetson AGX Orin module"  will show up

######### how to find out jetson ip address from host machine?

- identify the Network Interface
$ip addr

33: enp0s20f0u11u2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 42:0f:9e:c4:c9:a8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.55.100/24 brd 192.168.55.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp0s20f0u11u2
       valid_lft 13sec preferred_lft 13sec
    inet6 fe80::f5a4:b286:d54b:2285/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

- scan subnet
  This should list all devices in the 192.168.55.x subnet, and hopefully, you should be able to see your Jetson device in this list. 
  The IP address corresponding to the Jetson device should be different from the 192.168.55.100, which is the IP of the interface on your laptop in this subnet.
